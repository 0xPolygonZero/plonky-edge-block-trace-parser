# Plonky Edge block trace parser

This is a simple library dedicated to parsing [Polygon Edge](https://github.com/0xPolygon/polygon-edge) block traces into a format usable for txn proof generation within [plonky2](https://github.com/0xPolygonZero/plonky2) (and later also [plonky3](https://github.com/Plonky3)).

Note that at the time of writing  support for Edge block traces are currently not stable and only available on the `feat/zero` branch.
